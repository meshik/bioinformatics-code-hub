# Bioinformatics Code Hub
A curated collection of code for bioinformatic analyses for anyone to learn and copy for their own analyses

The following analyses are planned:
1. Genomics
   - Copy number variation analysis
   - GWAS (Genome-wide association studies)
2. Transcriptomics
   - fastq processing (quality control, trimming, alignment)
   - Bulk RNA-Seq
     - Differential expression
   - Single-Cell RNA-Seq
     - Cell Annotations
     - Psuedotime
     - Ligand-receptor interactions
3. Proteomics
   - Mass spectrometry 
   - Protein-protein interactions
   - Post-translational modifications
4. Metabolomics
   - Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
5. Epigenetics
   - DNA methylation
   - Chromatin accessibility analysis (ATAC-seq)
6. Metagenomics
   - 16S rRNA sequencing
   - Microbiome diversity
7. Computer Vision
   - Microscopy segmentation
   - MRI
8. Molecular Dynamics
   - MDVerse
