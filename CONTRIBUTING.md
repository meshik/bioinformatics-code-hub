# Contributing to Bioinformatic-Code-Hub
You can contribute your R/Python/Bash or other scripts and analyses by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
Another great non-code contribution is to open an issue with an analysis you want done, or expansion suggestions for existing analyses.

Analyses in rendered Jupyter notebooks are ideal for easily viewing and adapting the script.
Please add a simplified explanation of the purpose of the analysis at the top of the file.

Any other suggestions for the repository are welcome.
Feel free to contact me with the details in my profile :)

Thanks for helping to make bioinformatics more reproducible and accessible!
