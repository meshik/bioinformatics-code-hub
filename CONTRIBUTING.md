# Contributing to Bioinformatic-Code-Hub
You can contribute your R/Python/Bash or other scripts and analyses by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
Another great non-code contribution is to open an issue with an analysis you want done, or expansion suggestions for existing analyses.
Additionally, any ideas on improving the layout and purpose of this repo are always welcome!

Analyses should have at least the following parts:
- a simplified explanation of the purpose of the analysis at the top of the file
- an associated script for downloading the data programmatically
- preprocessing of the data
- several plots and the insight they provide
- a final section with typical next steps and additional considerations when adapting this analysis

Feel free to contact me with the details in my profile :)
Thanks for helping to make bioinformatics more reproducible and accessible!
