# Contributing to Bioinformatic-Code-Hub
You can contribute your R/Python/Bash or other scripts and analyses by forking the repository and submitting a pull request.
Another great non-code contribution is to open an issue with an analysis you think is necessary.

Analyses in rendered Jupyter notebooks are ideal for easily viewing and adapting the script.
Please add a simplified explanation of the purpose of the analysis at the top of the file.

Feel free to contact me at dekel@thewainers.com

Thanks!
